Currently, online shopping is spreading.  
We want to make a different online bookstore. Douban is a popular website for book review. We obtained vital data via crawler and implemented recommendation system based on Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithm. Apart from basic management parts, the online store deliberately includes CMR (customer relationship management) and pays attention to customer loyalty. The framework is from opencart. https://www.opencart.com/
